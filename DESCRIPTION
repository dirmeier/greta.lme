Description: perturbatr does stage-wise analysis of large-scale genetic
 perturbation screens for integrated data sets consisting of multiple screens.
 For multiple integrated perturbation screens a hierarchical model that
 considers the variance between different biological conditions is fitted.
 The resulting list of gene effects is then further extended using a network
 propagation algorithm to correct for false negatives.
